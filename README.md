# hello-world

Hi githubbers!

My name is William (if you haven't already guessed). I'm a student of web and software development looking to get the fundementals necessary to begin a career in the field. Currently working on Codecademy and Code School to get a foundation so I can start answering questions on places like here and stack overflow in order to build my portfolio.
